# Eneroth Unfold Tool

Unfold faces to a single plane.
Useful for parts being laser cut or printed on a single piece of paper.
Works both on raw faces and faces wrapped in groups or components.

Activated from *Extensions > Eneroth Unfold Tool*.

Click on a face you want to fold and then another face to fold onto its plane.
Keep clicking to unfold a series of faces.

To pick up a branching face along the way, e.g. a flap, hold Alt (Command on
Mac)to fold the clicked face onto the plane of the selection, rather than the
other way around.
